    <h4></h4>
    <p>I love to create and I love to solve problems. This is what led me to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering and to make a career shift into a Software Engineering and Web Development.</p>
    <p>Mechanical Engineering also sparked my love of empathetic design. I am fascinated by the human experience surrounding technology and passionate about designing the best experiences for people.</p>
    <p>All of my life, I have been a curious person and I plan to never lose that spark of curiosity. The spark helps me ensure I fully understand the problems I am solving and it has led me to never stop learning.</p>
